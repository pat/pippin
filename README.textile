h1. Pippin

Pippin is a Rails Engine for processing PayPal IPN requests. It automatically adds a route to your Rails application that validates and processes IPNs.

If you want to do something with those IPN objects (and I recommend you do), then all you need to do is attach a listener, and that'll fire as each valid IPN is received.

h2. Installation and Usage

Just add it to your Gemfile:

<pre><code>gem 'pippin', '~> 0.1.1'</code></pre>

Then, in an initializer, add your listener:

<pre><code># config/initializers/pippin.rb
Pippin.listener = lambda { |ipn|
  # use IPN data
  ipn.params # => {'business' => 'email@domain.com', 'txn_type' => ...}
}</code></pre>

Any parameters with the suffix '_date' in their name will automatically be translated from PayPal's ugly date string to an appropriate Time object.

When constructing your form that redirects people to PayPal, you'll want to set the @notify_url@ parameter to use Pippin's URL that has automatically been added to your routes: @pippin_ipns_url@.

h2. Contributing

Contributions are very much welcome - but keep in mind the following:

* Keep patches in a separate branch.
* Write tests for your patches.
* Don't mess with the version or history file. I'll take care of that when the patch is merged in.
